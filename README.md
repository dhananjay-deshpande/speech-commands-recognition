Speech Command Recognition on Cloud ML
--------------------------------------------------

Build a model to recognize speech commands from audio files. 

This repository is based on previous work done on classifying flower images which can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/flowers)

To run this example, first follow instructions for [setting up your environment](https://cloud.google.com/ml/docs/how-tos/getting-set-up).

Also, we use Apache Beam (running on Cloud Dataflow) so make sure to install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you may follow the instructions in sample.sh.
